# GPT-Search
This repository provides a Python script for performing Google searches and extracting text from the search results using GPT-3. The script takes in a search query as input, along with the user's OpenAI API key and the GPT-3 model ID, and returns the corresponding search results as well as summaries generated by the GPT-3 model.

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, use the following command:

    pip install langchain openai google-search-results

## Usage
Load the necessary libraries and set the environment variables for OpenAI API key and SERP API key.
javascript

    from langchain.agents import load_tools
    from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    import os
    
    os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
    os.environ['SERPAPI_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY_HERE"

Initialize the OpenAI language model and load the necessary tools.

    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    tool_names = ["serpapi"]
    tools = load_tools(tool_names)
    import os

Initialize the GPT-3 search agent using the loaded tools and language model.

    agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description")

Use the search agent to perform a search and generate summaries for the search results.

Initialize the OpenAI language model and load the necessary tools.

    query = "YOUR_SEARCH_QUERY_HERE"
    search_results = agent.get_search_results(query, num_results=10)
    for i, result in enumerate(search_results):
    print(f"\n\nResult {i+1}:")
    print(f"Title: {result.title}")
    print(f"Link: {result.link}")
    print(f"Summary: {result.summary}")
    print(f"Summary generated by GPT-3: {agent.generate_summary(result.summary)}")

Note: You need to have an account with OpenAI and SERP API to obtain the API keys.
